# ERC20 Recurring

# Summary

A new token standard for recurring approvals

# Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allows tokens to be periodically approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party. It is compatible with ERC20.

# Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges. It also provides a way for dApps to get recurring approvals for their token.
